        <h3>1: manipulate with video</h3>

        <pre>
        As a data structure professor, I want to have options to control the animation of the 
        selected data structure, so I can pause and play it for students, and they can view how 
        the data structure works step by step.
        
        Elaboration: users should be able to have controls of animation, because it’s an educational
        website, the point is to help users understand things. Thus we need to use JavaScript 
        to achieve the goal on the website.

        Constraints: none

        Effort Estimation: 4 hours

        Acceptance Test: 
        In the user Interface, the animation should be able to play and pause.

        In the user Interface, the animation should be able to rewind and forward.
        
        In the user Interface, once the animation has been play, pause, rewind, or forward it will save its progress in current time.

            2: Select multiple methods with variables
        </h3>

        <pre>
        As a cs student, I want to control the variables and methods with the selected data structure, so I can play 
        around with it in order to get a better understanding.
              
        Elaboration: users should have the ability to pick the methods and variables for selected data structures to show the 
        animation, so they can have the sense of what’s going on with the different combinations of  methods. 
        Thus, we need to build buttons for picking methods and variables, and set limited values for variables for users to choose.
              
        Constraints: the variable selection will be limited. 
              
        Effort Estimation: 10 hours
              
        Acceptance Test: In user interface, the user should be able to manipulate with methods and 
        limited variables, and the website should be able to generate and play the animation based 
        on the given methods and variables.

        <h3>3: Generate pseudo code</h3>

        <pre>
            As a new learner in coding, I would like to see a pseudo code for the methods I’ve 
            chosen for data structure, so I can get a better sense of feeling with coding in data 
            structure. Pseudo code is useful because it takes away the stress of trying to read 
            a program and trying to understand the data structure.
            
            
            Elaboration: The users are allowed to look at the generated pseudo code from the methods
            they’ve picked. Thus we need to have a function that can generate pseudo codes from 
            the user picks.
            
            Constraints: pseudo code will be based off of Java syntax.
            
            Effort Estimation: 10 hours
            
            Acceptance Test: in user interface, after users have picked their methods, it should 
            generate a pseudo code base on the methods users have chosen.

            4: Easy to use
        </h3>

        <pre>
        As a elementary school teacher, I need an interface that is easy to use.
              
        Elaboration: I need to use this website briefly for one week of class. I do not want anything
        with a steep learning curve as I do not have much time around my schedule to learn a new system.
              
        Constraints: none
              
        Effort Estimation: 5 person-hours
              
        Acceptance Test: An individual with baisc understanding of the content of the website should be able to navigate
        and use the site without need for any tutorials.

            5: Multiple languages implemented
        </h3>

        <pre>
        As a coding bootcamp instructor, I want there to be multiple languages
              
        Elaboration: The course that I teach is first taught in C and then in Javascript. I plan to demonstrate data structures
        to the class via both languages. There should be slight differences depending on the language being used. I would like
        at least those two languages implemented, but other folks might like more coding languages.

        Constraints: The number of languages used
              
        Effort Estimation: 20 person-hours
              
        Acceptance Test: There is clarification / modification on the animations based on the language selected.

            6: Open source 
        </h3>

        <pre>
        As a student, I would like to use the animation portion of your website in my own project.
              
        Elaboration: I am currently working on my own IDE with a group, I would like to add functionality to the debug portion
        that shows animation of the code highlighted. I would like to use to animations.
              
        Constraints: animations should 
              
        Effort Estimation: 4 person-hours
              
        Acceptance Test: The animations have their own class

            7: Real world example / tutorial
        </h3>

        <pre>
        As a parent, I want to teach my child some python code. Can you add a simple command line game to each
        data structure so that the lessons don't seem abstract.
              
        Elaboration: Add interactive interface so that the user is not just clicking and viewing, but can follow
        instructions to see how the data structure can be useful in a real world situation. Make the examples
        simple to understand. Some simple command line games would be a good method. For example maybe the game snake can
        show a stack method.
              
        Constraints: none
              
        Effort Estimation: 20 person-hours
              
        Acceptance Test: In the user interface there is a section that further develops the diagrams into an interactive tutorial.

            8: Animation customization
        </h3>

        <pre>
        As a student, I would like to have settings to customize the animation.
              
        Elaboration: I would like to be able to play / pause the animation, and to adjust the speed
        of the animations. I would also like to rewind / undo things.
              
        Constraints: none
              
        Effort Estimation: 3 person-hours
              
        Acceptance Test: There is a side panel that allows the user to customize.

        <pre>
        As a professor, I would like the website to work on multiple platforms for my students.
              
        Elaboration: I assign my homework over an online platform. My students use a variety of devices to
        complete their work. I need the website to function correctly and look good for all laptops,
        phones, and tablets.
              
        Constraints: The types of devices covered

        Elaboration: I would like a section at the bottom where I can help people who
        have questions about the data structures or just post helpful insights that I 
        would like to share.
              
        Constraints: none
