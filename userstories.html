        1: manipulate with video
        As a data structure professor, I want to have options to control the animation of the selected data structure, so I can pause and play it for students, and they can view how the data structure works step by step.
        
        Elaboration: users should be able to have controls of animation, because it’s an educational website, the point is to help users understand things. Thus we need to use JavaScript to achieve the goal on the website.
        
        Constraints: none
        
        Effort Estimation: 4 hours
        
        Acceptance Test: 
        In the user Interface, the animation should be able to play and pause.
        In the user Interface, the animation should be able to rewind and forward.
        In the user Interface, once the animation has been play, pause, rewind, or forward it will save its progress in current time.
        
        
        
        2: Select multiple methods with variables
        As a cs student, I want to control the variables and methods with the selected data structure, so I can play around with it in order to get a better understanding.
        
        Elaboration: users should have the ability to pick the methods and variables for selected data structures to show the animation, so they can have the sense of what’s going on with the different combinations of  methods. Thus, we need to build buttons for picking methods and variables, and set limited values for variables for users to choose.
        
        Constraints: the variable selection will be limited. 
        
        Effort Estimation: 10 hours
        
        Acceptance Test: In user interface, the user should be able to manipulate with methods and limited variables, and the website should be able to generate and play the animation based on the given methods and variables.
        
        3: Generate pseudo code
        As a new learner in coding, I would like to see a pseudo code for the methods I’ve chosen for data structure, so I can get a better sense of feeling with coding in data structure. Pseudo code is useful because it takes away the stress of trying to read a program and trying to understand the data structure.
        
        
        Elaboration: The users are allowed to look at the generated pseudo code from the methods they’ve picked. Thus we need to have a function that can generate pseudo codes from the user picks.
        
        Constraints: pseudo code will be based off of Java syntax, but not accurately (errors would come up if tried to compile)
        
        Effort Estimation: 10 hours
        
        Acceptance Test: in user interface, after users have picked their methods, it should generate a pseudo code base on the methods users have chosen.
