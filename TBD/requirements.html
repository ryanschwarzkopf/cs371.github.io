                <h3>Purpose of Product</h3>
                    <p>
                        As we all know team T.B.D. is creating an educational application for intro CS students. We will be creating an application that will give a visual representation to a pseudo code about a particular data structure. The purpose of this educational application is to provide extra insight on specific intro data structure types. This application is meant to provide easy accessible information for anyone that needs a visual representation of how each data structure communicates with the computer. It is noted that this is not meant to teach data structure. This application is meant for reviewing and further understanding the topic.
                    </p>
                <h3>Scope of product</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>User chooses functions/methods on website page</li>
                        <li>The data structure will have a drop down menu to pick a certain methods that applies to the selected data structure</li>
                        <li>A pseudo code and animation will be provided for each data structure</li>
                        <li>The pseudo code will have an arrow pointing to each line as the animation is playing</li>
                        <li>Supply brief descriptions on the data structures after animations(like zybook)</li>
                        <li>Supply example programs (maybe depends we do not want to get in trouble)</li>
                        <li>User input will not be allowed</li>
                        <li>Simple web design that used HTML, CSS, goJS, and (maybe Java)</li>
                        <li>Animation will have pause/play function</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Acronyms, Abbreviations, Definitions</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>data structure:  A specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. There are several basic and advanced types of data structures, all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose. Data structures make it easy for users to access and work with the data they need in appropriate ways.</li>
                        <li>Stacks: linear data structure that follows LIFO(Last in first out)</li>
                        <li>Queues: linear data structure that stores the elements sequentially. FIFO</li>
                        <li>Linked list: consists of a data element known as a node. And each node consists of two fields: one field has data, and in the second field, the node has an address that keeps a reference to the next node.</li>
                        <li>Binary Trees: a tree-type non-linear data structure with a maximum of two children for each parent</li>
                        <li>Arrays: collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together.</li>
                        <li>For/while Loops: programming construct that allows a program to do an action[s] repetitively as long as the conditions defined for the loop are met.</li>
                        <li>If/Else: a conditional statement that runs a different set of statements depending on whether an expression is true or false</li>
                    </ul>

            <h2>General Description of Product</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Context of Product</h3>
                    <p>
                        Products should be served in websites with HTML, CSS, JS, and java SimpleWebServer.
                    </p>
                <h3>Domain Model with Description</h3>
                    <a href="">Domain Model</a>
                    <p>---Descriptions---</p>
                <h3>Product Functions</h3>

                <h3>User Characteristics and Exprectations</h3>
                    <p>
                        User’s are students who want a refresher, better understanding of provided data structures, or struggling with the information. User’s are able to choose which data structure they would like to review. Each data structure allows the user to pick which following method(s) they want to see. 
                        User’s will be able to pause and play animations at their own time frame. User’s will be able to access example programs with short descriptions and explanations. User’s will experience a website that demonstrates the animation of how the data structure works based on the given pseudo code.
                    </p>
                <h3>Constraints</h3>
                    <p>
                        There will be no user input. Each example will be set and stone and not changed by the user.  Users will not be able to save where they left off or favorite specific data structures.
                        For team TBD our constraint is implementing pause/play/rewind/forward and how the pseudo code will update when the user use’s this function. 
                    </p>
                <h3>Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our team depends on Visual Studio Code IDE. This IDE is storing all of our work in order for us as a team to work on the project together.
                        Gojs.net is an external software package that our product will depend on for the animations.
