<div>
    <h3>Component Testing</h3>
    <p>
        For each function in the binary tree, we did a test to see if it works correctly.
	There are four functions in the binary tree, which are Create, Insert, Search, Remove
	Every function is functioning through our test cases.

<p> -Create
    -Testing create function in two cases
    First, see if Create will function when there's no tree, 
    Second, see if Create will function when there's a tree already.
    For the first case, the expected function result is creating a new tree.
    For the second case, the expected function result is to remove everything in the old tree, and create a new one.
</p>
	
 <p> 
        -Insert
		-Testing create function in two cases
		First, see if Insert will function when there's no tree, 
		Second, see if Insert will function when there's a tree already.
		For the first case, the expected function result is to insert no value because the tree has to be created first.
		For the second case, the expected function result is to insert a new node, and display the change.
 </p>
	
<p> 
    -Search
		-Testing create function in two cases
		First, see if Search will function when there's no tree,
		Second, see if Search will function when there's no node found,
		Third, see if Search will function when nodes are found.
		For the first case, the expected function result is sending a message of "there's no tree to find a node".
		For the second case, the expected function result is sending a message of "the node is not found".
		For the third case, the expected function result is sending a message of "the node is found", and displaying the index.
</p>
	
<p>
        -Remove
		-Testing create function in two cases
		First, see if Remove will function when there's no tree,
		Second, see if Remove will function when there's no node found,
		Third, see if Remove will function when nodes are found.
		For the first case, the expected function result is sending a message of "there's no tree to remove a node".
		For the second case, the expected function result is sending a message of "the node is not found".
		For the third case, the expected function result is sending a message of "the node is found, and removed", and remove the node from the tree.

    <h3>System Testing</h3>
    <p>
    -The project's system is working as we wanted, but less function than we expected.
	-We have dropped using GoJS, because some of the functions just won't work right, we switched to JS, and 
        that's how we get the project to work, so I'm sure that's the right call.
	-we use the github and browser to perform system testing.

<div>
    <h3>Acceptance Testing</h3>
    <p>
        The system used was basic JavaScript. Once the project
        was completed there was the decsison to make the Binary Search Tree
        simple to use with minimal design and attributes due to
        timing. Not all user stories were implemented, but we tried
        to focus on the main user stories for functionality.

        <h3>Component Testing</h3>
        <p>
            No unit testing tools were used when testing the 
            Stack data structure. The main test that was used
            was making sure the user input was displaying prop-
            erly. The way we tested this was inputing number and
            making adjustments to the code as needed. 
            I tested that each print statement to the user was
            accurate and displayed the correct message for each function.
            I also tested that each function properly updated each value
            on the stack when each function was being used.
        </p>
    </div>

        <h3>System Testing</h3>
        <p>
            The data used for system testing were random single digit
            and double digit numbers. The first test was the Push function.
            This function had an issue that it was not updating the website
            in real time. The solution to this was creating a delay and making
            the website refresh every one second.
            Each function went through the same test cases with random numbers.
            When testing the Top function, it was difficult to decide how to 
            demonstrate it. The solution was to highlight the top most element 
            on the stack which resulted in one issue. This error happened because
            the print statement was incorrectly displaying the value that was on the
            top of the stack. This was a simple fix that did not cause any other issues
            between the other functions.
