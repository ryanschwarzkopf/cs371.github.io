        Two candidates for the architecture style of this project were: the decomposition view and the dependencies view. 
        Advantages of decomposition view are that it easily portrays the system in programmable units. The advantage of 
        the dependencies view is that it is a useful design to see the impact a design change would have on the system.
        The style chosen is the decomposition view because it was the easiest way to view the small system.
